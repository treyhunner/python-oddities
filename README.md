# Python Oddities and Peculiarities

These are snippets of Python code with results that you may find surprising, especially if you're new to Python.

## Categories

- **gotchas**: these sometimes bite new Python programmers. The most useful sort of oddity to discuss.
    - Example: mutable default function arguments
- **curiosities**: a peculiarity that's unexpected, but not something you'd care about day-to-day
    - Example: `-5` to `256` are always identical but other numbers aren't
- **absurdities**: absurd code, just for the fun of it
    - example: `{*()}` vs. `set()`
