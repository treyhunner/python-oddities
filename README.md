Yes this repository will be renamed soon...

## Categories

I'm considering grouping oddities by category.
Here are the categories I'm considering:

- **gotchas**: these sometimes bite new Python programmers. The most useful sort of oddity to discuss.
    - example: mutable default function arguments
    - possible alternate names: **quirks**, **idiosyncrasies**, **surprises**
- **curiosities**: a peculiarity that's unexpected, but not something you'd care about day-to-day
    - example: `-5` to `256` are always identical but other numbers aren't
    - possible alternate names: **peculiarities**, **interestingness**
- **silly**: absurd code, just for the fun of it
    - example: `{*()}` vs. `set()`
    - possible alternate names: **absurd**, **silliness**, **absurdities**

Have thoughts on the project layout?
